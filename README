This is code to check that I have wifi connection. Checks if I can connect to google and the noutputs it into a log. Logs are separated by day. I then used cron to automate this. Pasted the steps below.


cd ~/
crontab -e
*/10 * * * * cd ~/Documents/wificheck && /usr/local/bin/python3 wifi.py >> ~/Documents/wificheck/cron.txt 2>&1



* * * * * cd ~/path/ && /usr/local/bin/python3 filename >> ~/path/to/errorlog.txt 2>&1

I did every 10 minutes but can be customized. Use https://crontab.guru/
